# bf-api

API service for the Beachfront project.


## Installing

From project root:

```
$ virtualenv --python=python3.5 .env
$ . .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running in development mode

#### 1. Install PostgreSQL + PostGIS on your machine

Even if you intend to point at a remote database, [`psycopg2` has a runtime dependency on
`libpq`](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html), which is bundled with most PostgreSQL distributions.

> **Tip:** If you're running MacOS, the simplest setup/configuration route is to just use
> [Postgres.app](http://postgresql.org/download/macosx/) which includes both PostgreSQL and the PostGIS extensions.


#### 2. Create `.environment-vars.dev.sh` with the contents:

```
export DOMAIN=<some target domain>
export SYSTEM_API_KEY=<valid Piazza API key>
export PORT=5000
export VCAP_SERVICES='{valid json blob}'
```

> **Tip:** You can get `VCAP_SERVICES` by running `cf env bf-api` or checking
> the environment variables from the PCF web management portal.
>
> [More about `VCAP_SERVICES`](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES)

#### 3. From the terminal, execute:

```
$ ./scripts/run-in-development-mode.sh
```


## Running unit tests

From the terminal, execute:

```
$ ./scripts/test.sh
```


## Deploying

1. Either `cf push` or use the normal CI build pipeline to deploy to PCF.
2. Provide credentials to the running instance by `cf set-env bf-api SYSTEM_API_KEY <valid Piazza API key>` or
via the PCF web management portal.

```
$ cf set-env bf-api SYSTEM_API_KEY <valid Piazza API key>
```
